# WHAT'S FOR DINNER

The "What's for Dinner" website is designed to be a responsive website allowing visitors to view on a range of devices. It allows visitors to choose between different cuisines, meal preparation time and ingredients and receive meal suggestions and recipes based on their selection. I built it to reduce decision-fatigue and time spent planning meals.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

What's for Dinner is a time management tool that helps users plan and organise meals. Users can choose from different categories depending on their mood to receive meal suggestions that include links to recipes. What's for dinner exists to make meal planning more efficient by reducing time spent deciding what to eat, finding recipes and writing shopping lists.

Key information for the site
* What categories are there?
* How long does each meal take to prep and cook?
* A recipe for each suggestion.
* Updates on what is planned for future versions of the website/app.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I used browns (with hints of bright green) to mirror the color of the earth all of the delicious plant-based food grows from, along with calming blues to enhance the feeling of stress-reduction that the application will bring to users.

### Typography
Jura from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jura) is used throughout the site, the font is calm, legible and un-cluttered. It is an accessible sans-serif font.

## Features

The website comprises of one page. The header contains a logo and a tagline that hints towards the purpose of the site.

![picture alt](/readme/logo.png "fontawesome cutlery logo and tagline 'I'm in the mood for...'")

Underneath the header is the category selection area. Here the user will select a button that reflects the type of meal they are "in the mood for". If the user selects "irish" then images of Irish meals will display in the food section. The images will be acompanied by a title, total cook time and a link to a recipe. There will be a button that when clicked, a random meal will be displayed if the user does not want to pick any specific category.

### Future Implementations

* I would like to add multiple selection functionality onto the category buttons, and that buttons with conflicting categories would become disabled until the selection is cleared or the original category button is unclicked
* I want to make it possible for the user to create their own categories and add their favorite meals and recipes
* I want to add a "favorites" button
* I would change the layout of the categories area to reduce clutter - with drop-down or pop-out menus for sub-categories

## Testing

Section not complete, full information not updated to readme

rought notes copy and pasted:"

I learned how to  use “ctrl” “shift” and “l” when selecting characters or lines of code to search the entire document for exact matches in order to bulk edit all the matches

I had not put class names for “cook time”, “ingredients” and “shopping list” and it would have been very time consuming to edit each line of code individually"

Manual testing: “filter selection is not defined” (syntax error amended)
