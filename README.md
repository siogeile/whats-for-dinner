# WHAT'S FOR DINNER

The "What's for Dinner" website is designed to be a responsive website allowing visitors to view on a range of devices. It allows visitors to choose between different cuisines, meal preparation time and ingredients and receive meal suggestions and recipes based on their selection. I built it to reduce decision-fatigue and time spent planning meals.
